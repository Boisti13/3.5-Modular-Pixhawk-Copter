# 3.5-Modular-Pixhawk-Copter
3.5" Modular Ardupilot Pixhawk Quadcopter

My goal is to develop a modular, 3.5" quadcopter for research. 

The main keypoints are:
- easily replaceable frame parts
- full blown Pixhawk 4 as main FCU
- Lidar for altitude control
- Optical flow for indoor Position Hold / Navigation
- Compatibility with the VICON-System for indoor navigation
- Usability with a "cable copter" power system for long indurance indoor testing
- Printable frame parts, optimized for SLS printing
